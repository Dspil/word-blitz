* Word Blitz
A Solver for the Facebook messenger Word Blitz game (greek version). 
It reads the board recognizing the depicted letters (using KNN) and modifiers and then uses the mouse to enter the solution.
The solution is computed using a DFS search at the intersection of the tree graph extracted from the board and the tree graph composed using a lexicon of the greek language.
The lexicon was downloaded from the Aspell dictionaries at https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html.
The bot is now only usable from a 1366x768 screen using Mozilla Firefox.
